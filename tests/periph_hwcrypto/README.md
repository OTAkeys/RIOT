Expected result
===============
This application will run all supported hardware accelerated ciphers and hashing algorithms.

For the ones supported, no error should be raised. Note that this test only checks if the
implementation works, and does not verify results against reference results.

Background
==========
Test for the low-level hardware crypto driver.
